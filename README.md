# K Nearest Neighbour Classification with Weighted Option 

This work was done for Data Mining lecture. The instructor's expectation was the implementation of the standard version of KNN for a data set chosen by the students.

I wanted it to work for each dataset, have more features, and a weighted version as an option.I tried to write only to be dependent on NumPy and Pandas.

I wanted to write and put it because I couldn't find anything like this on GitHub.

I took the Sklearn library as an example. I did not intend to coding anything as comprehensive as them, my work much more slowly than their tools.

I wanted students who do research like me to find understandable codes and benefit them.

I hope to make additions to BallTree, KDTree or PCA hereafter.

Contents:

- KNNClassifier class, include fit, predict, evaluation and classification_report methods.

- random_train_test_split function.

- Kfold function to use with the KNNClassifier.

- mode function.

Detailed explanations are in the document.
